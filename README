Vim snippets and vim files all managed with pathogen and bundled as submodules whenever possible.

I highly recommend using my dotfiles which has my vimfiles as a submodule
[https://github.com/doug/dotfiles](https://github.com/doug/dotfiles)

so you don't need to check this out directly

but if you do make sure to update the submodules

git submodule update --init --recursive

or

just clone with the --recursive flag

bundle requirements
===================

command-t
---------
for command-t bundle must build with the correct version of ruby
for rvm use system or rvm use 1.8.7 is probably correct
then rake make from the command-t bundle directory

pysmell
-------
pip install pysmell

ctags
-----
ubuntu: sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
mac: brew install ctags
